# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to simplify and consolidate the event management system by eliminating redundancy between enhanced-events.js and combined-events.js while maintaining a clean modular architecture. The goal is to have a single, efficient event management system that handles all event-related functionality without code duplication.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single unified event management system, so that I can maintain cleaner code without duplication and confusion between multiple event managers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is refactored THEN there SHALL be only one primary event management module
2. WHEN events are added or updated THEN the system SHALL handle both basic event operations and statistics updates through the same interface
3. WHEN the system is initialized THEN it SHALL provide all event functionality through a single entry point

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain the existing modular design principles, so that the event system remains maintainable and follows the established architecture patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the event system is simplified THEN it SHALL maintain clear separation of concerns
2. WHEN other modules interact with events THEN they SHALL use consistent, well-defined interfaces
3. WHEN the system is refactored THEN existing functionality SHALL remain intact and accessible

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate redundant code between event management files, so that the codebase is more maintainable and less prone to inconsistencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN duplicate functionality is identified THEN it SHALL be consolidated into a single implementation
2. WHEN statistics calculation occurs THEN it SHALL use the same data source and logic as basic event operations
3. WHEN event updates happen THEN both display updates and statistics SHALL be handled by the same system

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user of the application, I want all existing event functionality to continue working seamlessly, so that the refactoring doesn't break any current features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN events are recorded THEN they SHALL appear in the timeline as before
2. WHEN event statistics are displayed THEN they SHALL show accurate counts and information
3. WHEN events are edited or deleted THEN the operations SHALL work exactly as they did previously
4. WHEN the system handles different event types THEN all current event types SHALL be supported

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved performance and reduced memory usage, so that the application runs more efficiently with the simplified event system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is simplified THEN it SHALL reduce the number of event listeners and DOM operations
2. WHEN events are processed THEN the system SHALL avoid duplicate calculations and updates
3. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL initialize fewer event management instances
