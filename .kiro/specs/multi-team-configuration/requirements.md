# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will transform the current Netherton United-specific GameTime application into a configurable multi-team application. The goal is to centralize all team-specific information (names, logos, themes, integration URLs) into a single configuration file, making it easy for other teams and clubs to customize the application for their use without modifying code.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a team administrator, I want to configure my team's branding and information through a single configuration file, so that I can easily customize the application for my team without technical knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load team configuration from a centralized config file
2. WHEN team configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL use sensible default values and display a setup prompt
3. WHEN configuration is updated THEN the system SHALL apply changes immediately without requiring code modifications
4. WHEN multiple teams use the application THEN each team SHALL have their own unique configuration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a team administrator, I want to customize my team's visual branding (name, logo, colors, theme), so that the application reflects my team's identity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring team branding THEN the system SHALL allow setting team name, logo URL, primary colors, and theme
2. WHEN team logo is configured THEN the system SHALL display the custom logo in the header and PWA icons
3. WHEN team colors are configured THEN the system SHALL apply the colors to the application theme
4. WHEN team name is configured THEN the system SHALL update all references throughout the application
5. WHEN PWA manifest is generated THEN the system SHALL use team-specific name, colors, and icons

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a team administrator, I want to configure default team names and opponent naming conventions, so that match setup is streamlined for my team's typical games.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up a new match THEN the system SHALL pre-populate the home team with the configured team name
2. WHEN configuring team settings THEN the system SHALL allow setting default opponent name format
3. WHEN team names are configured THEN the system SHALL update all UI elements that display team names
4. WHEN saving match data THEN the system SHALL use the configured team identifiers

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a team administrator, I want to configure external integrations (league tables, statistics APIs), so that the application can connect to my team's specific data sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring integrations THEN the system SHALL allow setting league table URLs and API endpoints
2. WHEN league table is accessed THEN the system SHALL use the configured URL to fetch team-specific data
3. WHEN integration URLs are invalid THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
4. WHEN no integrations are configured THEN the system SHALL disable related features gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer or technical administrator, I want clear documentation and examples for configuration setup, so that I can easily deploy the application for new teams.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up for a new team THEN the system SHALL provide a sample configuration file with all available options
2. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating what needs to be fixed
3. WHEN deploying the application THEN the system SHALL include documentation explaining all configuration options
4. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL validate the configuration format

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an end user, I want the application to work seamlessly regardless of which team's configuration is loaded, so that the user experience remains consistent across different team deployments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the application THEN all functionality SHALL work identically regardless of team configuration
2. WHEN team configuration changes THEN existing match data SHALL remain compatible
3. WHEN switching between team configurations THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity
4. WHEN configuration is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL continue to function with default settings
