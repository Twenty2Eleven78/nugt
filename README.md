A configurable football match tracking application that can be customized for any team or club. Track matches, manage rosters, record events, and maintain statistics with a professional, mobile-optimized interface.

## Quick Start

2. **Configure your team** by editing `team-config.json`
3. **Deploy** to your web server or hosting platform
4. **Access** the application and start tracking matches

## Team Configuration Setup

### Overview

GameTime uses a single configuration file (`team-config.json`) to customize the application for your team. This file controls team branding, names, integrations, and default settings without requiring any code changes.

### Configuration File Location

The configuration file should be placed in the root directory of your application:
```
your-app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ team-config.json  ‚Üê Your team configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ js/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ css/
```

### Basic Configuration

Here's a minimal configuration to get started:

```json
{
  "team": {
    "name": "Your Team Name",
    "shortName": "YTN",
    "abbreviation": "YTN",
    "defaultOpponentName": "Opposition"
  },
  "branding": {
    "primaryColor": "#dc3545",
    "secondaryColor": "#ffffff",
    "logoUrl": "./your-logo.png",

  }
}
```

#### Storage Settings

### Step-by-Step Setup Guide

#### 1. Prepare Your Assets

Before configuring, prepare these files:
- **Team Logo**: PNG or JPG, recommended size 200x200px
- **App Icon**: PNG, 512x512px for PWA functionality
- **Favicon**: ICO file, 32x32px

#### 2. Edit Configuration File

1. Open `team-config.json` in a text editor
2. Update the `team` section with your team information
3. Modify `branding` colors and asset paths
4. Configure `pwa` settings for mobile app functionality
5. Set up `integrations` if you have league table URLs
6. Adjust `defaults` to match your typical match setup
7. Update `storage.keyPrefix` to use your team abbreviation

#### 3. Upload Assets

Place your logo, icon, and favicon files in the application directory and ensure the paths in your configuration match the file locations.

#### 4. Test Configuration

1. Open the application in a web browser
2. Check that your team name appears correctly
3. Verify that your logo and colors are applied
4. Test creating a new match to ensure defaults work
5. If you're an admin, use the configuration modal to validate settings

#### 5. Deploy Application

Deploy the configured application to your web server, hosting platform, or CDN. The application works with any static hosting service.

### Configuration Validation

The application automatically validates your configuration on startup:
- **Missing file**: Uses default Netherton United configuration
- **Invalid JSON**: Shows error message and uses defaults
- **Missing required fields**: Uses default values for missing fields
- **Invalid values**: Shows warnings and uses fallback values

### Advanced Configuration

#### Custom Storage Prefixes

If multiple teams use the same hosting environment, ensure each team has a unique `storage.keyPrefix`:

```json
{
  "storage": {
    "keyPrefix": "myteam_",
    "cachePrefix": "myteam-cache-"
  }
}
```

#### League Table Integration

To integrate with your league's online table:

```json
{
  "integrations": {
    "leagueTable": {
      "enabled": true,
      "defaultUrl": "https://your-league-website.com/table",
      "corsProxies": [
        "https://corsproxy.io/?",
        "https://api.allorigins.win/get?url="
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Multiple Team Configurations

For clubs with multiple teams, create separate deployments with different configurations, or use the configuration management UI to switch between team setups.
