- ✅ Correct card statistics (yellow and red cards)
- ✅ Proper foul counting
- ✅ Total event calculation (all goals + match events)
- ✅ Comprehensive statistics with mixed event types
- ✅ Real-time statistics updates when events change

## Mock Dependencies

The test suite uses comprehensive mocks for all external dependencies:

- **gameState**: Mock game state with goals and match events arrays
- **stateManager**: Mock state management operations
- **domCache**: Mock DOM element access
- **notificationManager**: Mock notification system
- **storageHelpers**: Mock data persistence
- **attendanceManager**: Mock attendance tracking
- **timerController**: Mock timer operations
- **EVENT_TYPES**: Mock event type constants
- **Utils**: Mock utility functions (time formatting, etc.)

## Error Handling Tests

The test suite specifically validates error handling for:

1. **Input Validation Errors**
   - Invalid data types
   - Missing required fields
   - Out-of-range values
   - Malformed data structures

2. **Operation Validation Errors**
   - Invalid operation types
   - Unauthorized operations
   - State consistency violations
   - Resource limit violations

3. **Data Integrity Errors**
   - Inconsistent team associations
   - Invalid time sequences
   - Corrupted event data
   - Missing dependencies

## Performance Considerations

The test suite is designed to:
- Execute quickly (< 1 second for all tests)
- Use minimal memory footprint
- Provide clear, actionable error messages
- Support both interactive and automated execution

## Integration with CI/CD

The Node.js test runner provides:
- Exit code 0 for success, 1 for failure
- Structured console output
- Environment variable support for configuration
- Compatibility with standard testing frameworks

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to the test suite:
1. **Performance Tests**: Add tests for large datasets (1000+ events)
2. **Concurrency Tests**: Test simultaneous operations
3. **Memory Tests**: Validate memory usage patterns
4. **Integration Tests**: Test with real DOM elements
5. **Regression Tests**: Add tests for specific bug scenarios

## Maintenance

The test suite should be updated when:
- New validation rules are added
- Event operation methods are modified
- New event types are introduced
- Performance requirements change
- Bug fixes require regression tests

## Conclusion

This comprehensive test suite ensures the reliability and correctness of the core event operations in the unified event management system. All tests are currently passing, providing confidence in the system's ability to handle event validation, CRUD operations, and statistics calculation accurately and safely.
