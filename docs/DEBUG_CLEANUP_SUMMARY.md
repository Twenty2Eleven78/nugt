# Debug Code Cleanup Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the debug code cleanup performed on the NUFC GameTime App admin functionality.

## Files Removed
- `simple-admin-test.js` - Admin testing script used for debugging
- `test-pwa-update.html` - PWA update testing page

## Console Statement Cleanup
Cleaned up non-essential console.log statements from the following files:

### Main Application Files
- `js/main.js`
  - Removed unused event parameters in event listeners
  - Converted console.log to comments for preloading messages

### Admin Modal (`js/modules/ui/admin-modal.js`)
- Removed console.error statements that were redundant with user notifications
- Kept essential error handling but removed debug logging

### UI Modules
- `js/modules/ui/touch-gestures.js` - Converted initialization log to comment
- `js/modules/ui/team-modals.js` - Converted initialization log to comment
- `js/modules/ui/roster-modal.js` - Converted initialization log to comment

- Kept the utility functions as they may be useful for troubleshooting

## What Was Preserved
- Error console statements that provide valuable debugging information
- Warning console statements for important issues
- Console statements in error boundary and storage manager (essential for monitoring)
- All functional code and legitimate temporary data handling

## Production Readiness
The application is now cleaner for production use with:
- Reduced console noise
- No test files in the deployment
- Maintained error reporting for essential debugging
- Preserved all functionality

## Notes
- The debug.js file is retained as it provides useful utilities for troubleshooting
- Essential error logging is preserved for production monitoring
- All admin functionality remains fully operational
